# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code that performs a specific duty. It can take in no arguments, or take in one or more arguments. You would use a function in a situation where you are performing a repetative task that could require alot of code. Things would be tedious and messy if we had to constantly perform a specific task over and over again; mistakes are high when we do that. So to save time, hardship and acheive conciseness, functions are tools that help writing programs become easier, faster, and neater.

2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() is a method that takes in a function loops through its argument and returns the same type and length of an argument it is fed. .filter() does the same, except, it returns the product of a specified conditional within the function. The length could be larger or smaller than what the argument it is fed.

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is like a print statement, where it just logs whatever it is fed in the console. It is helpful for debugging but also to visualize what your program is running.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is a statement or requirement that is fed into the function. For example: if the function you are looking at is meant to observe and do something to arrays, then its argument should be an array, and the same goes with any other data type. Some functions don't require arguments, but most require either one or more arguments to run.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Assuming we are working with the drive/navigate technique of pair programming, some techniques that set both parties up for a smooth experience/success are communicating honestly, using accurate vocabulary, understanding that people have different ways of looking at and processing information, assuming good intent in your partners' words and behaviors, and maybe adressing an issue politely if there feels to be one in the moment. If one person is the driver, then they should be listening to their partner (the navigator), following their input. That's not to say the driver has no input and is supposed to soley be the navigator's fingers, but they should allow the navigator to dictate what is to be done.

6. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is one run-through of a line or block of code. If you have one line of code and run that, that is one iteration. If you run that same line again, that is another iteration. Loops, for example, go through however many "iterations" you assign it to run. If the second argument in a for-loop is specified to 5, then that loop will iterate through your code 5 times.

7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer: Advantages for using the terminal to interact with your computer are that it can be quicker access to certain files and it's neater because you don't have to open a bunch of GUI windows. You can also run and see the results of your program within the terminal without opening the text editor in which your program lives. Some disadvantages are that you can get a little lost in the navigation of certain files, accidental deletions of important files can happen, the changing of certain locations of files can happen, etc. It is a fragile tool that can be deadly if used improperly, but seamless if used sagely.

8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Definitely learning git has been helpful. I used to be terrified of what the terminal was capable of doing since I knew and understood very little about how it functioned. Now I feel much more confident transitioning from file to file, along with pushing and pulling files onto github.
