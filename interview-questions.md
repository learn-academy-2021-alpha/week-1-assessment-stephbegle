# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code that performs a specific duty. It can take in no arguments, or take in one or more arguments. You would use a function in a situation where you are performing a repetative task that could require alot of code. Things would be tedious and messy if we had to constantly perform a specific task over and over again; mistakes are high when we do that. So to save time, hardship and acheive conciseness, functions are tools that help writing programs become easier, faster, and neater. 

  Researched answer: A function can be seen as a procedure or block of statements that perform a task or calculate a value. For the procedure to function, it needs to take in some input, and then return the output of the assigned procedure. It is extremely useful in coding because you can create a program that performs a task once, and use it over and over again wherever youd like. It is a way to structure larger programs and reduce repetition, and to isolate certain programs from others.

2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() is a method that takes in a function loops through its argument and returns the same type and length of an argument it is fed. .filter() does the same, except, it returns the product of a specified conditional within the function. The length could be larger or smaller than what the argument it is fed.   

  Researched answer: .map() is a method that creates a new array of elements of the same length of whatever array it was initially fed to its function. It allows the user to loop through every element in an array and manipulate it to whatever form necessary/wanted and returns a totally new array with the newly manipulated values. .filter() on the other hand, returns a subset of the array it is fed, based on conditions specified by its function. It is best used for when the user needs to identify certain items within an array.

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is like a print statement, where it just logs whatever it is fed in the console. It is helpful for debugging but also to visualize what your program is running. 

  Researched answer: console.log() is a function that will display/log whatever is fed to its parameter/argument on the console window/terminal. Return is a statement necessary in every function, and specifies when the program has ended and outputs the product of the program specifications onto the console/terminal.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is a statement or requirement that is fed into the function. For example: if the function you are looking at is meant to observe and do something to arrays, then its argument should be an array, and the same goes with any other data type. Some functions don't require arguments, but most require either one or more arguments to run. 

  Researched answer: an argument can be an array-like object or a sole object, that contains the necessary values needed to pass into a function in order for a function to do its job.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Assuming we are working with the drive/navigate technique of pair programming, some techniques that set both parties up for a smooth experience/success are communicating honestly, using accurate vocabulary, understanding that people have different ways of looking at and processing information, assuming good intent in your partners' words and behaviors, and maybe adressing an issue politely if there feels to be one in the moment. If one person is the driver, then they should be listening to their partner (the navigator), following their input. That's not to say the driver has no input and is supposed to soley be the navigator's fingers, but they should allow the navigator to dictate what is to be done.   

  Researched answer: Both parties need to be engaged throughout the entire pair programming session. There should be a running line of commentary, speaking out-loud to each other rather than keeping thoughts of the possibilities that can be down in a project keeps both parties engaged and in-tune with each other. If the driver is silent, then the navigator should be speaking, if the navigator is silent, then the driver should be speaking, but lengthy silent pauses are indicative of poor synergy. Both parties should be able to effectively communicate with each other and delegate the tasks that need to be worked through.

6. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is one run-through of a line or block of code. If you have one line of code and run that, that is one iteration. If you run that same line again, that is another iteration. Loops, for example, go through however many "iterations" you assign it to run. If the second argument in a for-loop is specified to 5, then that loop will iterate through your code 5 times.    

  Researched answer: An iteration is the action of processing each item within a given collection. It is the mechanism that allows loops to perform their duty of checking every single element within, say, an array.

7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer: Advantages for using the terminal to interact with your computer are that it can be quicker access to certain files and it's neater because you don't have to open a bunch of GUI windows. You can also run and see the results of your program within the terminal without opening the text editor in which your program lives. Some disadvantages are that you can get a little lost in the navigation of certain files, accidental deletions of important files can happen, the changing of certain locations of files can happen, etc. It is a fragile tool that can be deadly if used improperly, but seamless if used sagely. 

  Researched answer: Using the terminal uses less RAM (memory) than the user interface does. It can also be a tool of speed; producing quicker results of file searches and git pushes. The terminal uses less CPU processing time than the GUI (graphical user interface) does. And, apparently, a command line input (CLI) does not require windows to run. Some of the disadvantages include: the confusion that comes with knowing the necessary commands, if there is a spelling error in the command, the computer will simply not recognize it which can make the user waste time, and if you do mess up, you typically need to start from the very beginning of the action you were trying to accomplish. There are also just so many commands that should be learned in order to navigate seamlessly through the terminal, and that can be a tedious memory task even if you have it written down somewhere.

8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Definitely learning git has been helpful. I used to be terrified of what the terminal was capable of doing since I knew and understood very little about how it functioned. Now I feel much more confident transitioning from file to file, along with pushing and pulling files onto github.  



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Jest - a JavaScript testing framework used for debugging. It runs previously failed tests first and re-organizes runs based on how long test files take. There are many things that Jest allows the user to do, including mock testing which gives the user the ability to mock an object and see how it performs outside of a test's scope.

- Test Driven Development - a software development process that convert software into test cases before full development and repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. Used to find all possible bugs a program may have out in the real world. This is used in opposition of testing after the software is fully developed.

- Classes - they are the blueprint for creating new objects. A class is not an object but can be used to create new objects when referencing the class. They can be viewed as special functions that create new objects.
